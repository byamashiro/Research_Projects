# Proton Event Onset Time Challenge

Challenge:
- Create an automated program to detect the start times, durations, and end times for the list of events.
- Brief description of algorithm (i.e. Used " " filter and threshold)

Rules:
1. Must be a pythonic solution
2. Proton onset times must come after X-ray start time
3. Automation should detect at least 90% of provided events
4. Enter values on spreadsheet provided

Event List Information
1. 20+ events to attempt
2. Dates marked in "red" indicate backside or filament eruptions
	- This indication represents a delayed proton onset with respect to the start time
	- Attempt "non-red" events that have flare start times first

Data:
- 5-min. time-averaged data from NOAA GOES-13 detector will be provided
	- Separated by months
- Use >100 MeV channel column, "ZPGT100W"
	- Description:
		float ZPGT100W(record);
		ZPGT100W:description = "Flux of >100 MeV protons from the A detector that faces either East or West depending on the yaw flip of the satellite with	a	correction applied to remove contaminating particles";
		ZPGT100W:long_label = "protons-gt100-A (>100 MeV) corrected flux";
		ZPGT100W:short_label = "pgt100A cor fx";
		ZPGT100W:plot_label = "pA(>100 MeV)c";
		ZPGT100W:lin_log = "log";
		ZPGT100W:units = "p/(cm^2 s sr)";
		ZPGT100W:format = "E10.4";
		ZPGT100W:nominal_min = "1.0000E-02";
		ZPGT100W:nominal_max = "1.0000E+06";
		ZPGT100W:missing_value = "-99999";
- Caveats
	- Missing data marked as, "-99999"
